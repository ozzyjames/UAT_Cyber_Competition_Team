IP Addresses
Public IP addresses are provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for a monthly fee
IPv4 uses a 32-bit numbering system, allowing for 2^32 (approx. 4.29 billion) IP addresses
IPv6 uses a 128-bit numbering system, supporting up to 2^128 (approx. 340 trillion) IP addresses, resolving the limitations of IPv4
Windows Firewall Defender
Is a Host firewall (a host firewall is a program that ships as part of your system or is installed)
MAC Address
MAC stands for Media Access Control
A MAC address is a 12-character hexadecimal number split into two's and separated by colons (e.g., a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d)
The first 6 characters represent the manufacturer, and the last 6 are a unique identifier
Ping and ICMP
Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to test the performance and reliability of a connection between devices
Ping measures the time taken for ICMP echo packets to travel between devices and receive a reply
Ping can be performed against devices on a network or websites using the command ping <IP address or URL>
LAN Topologies
Star Topology: Devices are individually connected to a central networking device (switch or hub)
Bus Topology: Devices are connected to a single backbone cable, which can cause bottlenecks and difficulty in troubleshooting
Ring Topology: Devices are connected directly to each other in a loop, requiring less cabling and dedicated hardware
Network Devices
Switch: Used to centrally connect multiple devices on a local network and transmit data to the correct location
Router: Connects networks and passes data between them using routing
Subnetting
Subnetting divides a network into smaller pieces
There are 32 bits in a subnet mask, and each octet can range from 0-255
Network Addressing
Network Address: Identifies the start of a network
Host Address: Identifies devices within a network
Default Gateway: The device responsible for sending data to another network
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
ARP allows devices to identify themselves on a network by associating their MAC address with an IP address
Devices keep a log of MAC addresses associated with other devices
When a device wants to communicate with another, it sends a broadcast to the entire network searching for the specific device's MAC address
If a device has the requested IP address, it sends an ARP reply with its MAC address
The initial device stores this MAC address and IP address mapping in its ARP cache
IP addresses can be assigned in two ways:
Manual Assignment
IP addresses are physically entered into a device.
Automatic Assignment (Most Common)
A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server is used.
When a device connects to a network and does not have a manually assigned IP address, it follows these steps:
The device sends a DHCP Discover request to check for DHCP servers on the network.
The DHCP server responds with a DHCP Offer, suggesting an IP address for the device to use.
The device sends a DHCP Request, confirming its acceptance of the offered IP address.
The DHCP server sends a DHCP ACK (Acknowledgment), allowing the device to start using the assigned IP address.
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model
Fundamental, critical model in networking
Provides framework for how networked devices send, receive, interpret data
Benefit: Allows devices with different functions/designs to communicate on a network
Data sent follows OSI model uniformity, understandable by other devices
7 Layers of OSI Model (Layer 7 to Layer 1):
Key Points:
Each layer has different responsibilities
As data travels through layers, specific processes occur
Information is added to data (encapsulation process)
Layer 7: Application Layer
Most familiar layer to users
Provides protocols and rules for user interaction with data (send/receive)
Examples:
Email clients
Web browsers
File transfer software (e.g., FileZilla)
Provide Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user interaction
Other protocols:
DNS (Domain Name System)
Translates website addresses to IP addresses
Layer 6: Presentation Layer
Standardization of data begins
Acts as a translator for data to/from Application Layer (Layer 7)
Allows different software/formats to communicate
Example: Different email clients can display email content consistently
Handles data encryption and security features
HTTPS (secure website) encryption occurs at this layer
Layer 5: Session Layer
Establishes connection (session) between computers for data transfer
Session remains active while connection is live
Responsibilities:
Synchronizes computers to ensure readiness before data exchange
Divides data into smaller chunks (packets) for transfer
Beneficial for recovering from connection loss (only resend remaining chunks)
Sessions are unique - data cannot travel across different sessions
Key Points:
Manages sessions between computers
Prepares data for transfer by dividing into packets
Improves reliability by allowing partial retransmission if needed
Layer 4: Transport Layer
Vital for transmitting data across a network
Uses one of two protocols based on specific factors:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Designed for reliability and guarantee
Establishes constant connection between devices for data transfer
Incorporates error checking
Ensures data chunks from Session Layer are received and reassembled in order
Used for services that require accuracy and completeness
File sharing, web browsing, email, etc.







In the diagram below, we can see how a picture of a cat is broken down into small pieces of data (known as packets) from the "webserver", where the "computer" re-constructs the picture of the cat into the correct order.





UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Less advanced than TCP
No error checking or reliability features
Data is sent without synchronization or guarantee of delivery
Useful for small data transfers and situations where some data loss is acceptable
Device discovery protocols like ARP, DHCP
Video streaming (some pixelation is okay)












Layer 3: Network Layer
Where routing and reassembly of data chunks (packets) occur
Routing determines optimal path for packet delivery
Routing Factors:
Shortest path (fewest devices to cross)
Most reliable path (least packet loss)
Fastest physical connection (fiber > copper)
Routing Protocols:
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
Determine optimal routes based on factors above
IP Addressing:
Operates using IP addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.100)
Devices like routers capable of IP routing = Layer 3 devices
Key Points:
Handles routing and reassembly of packets
Routing protocols find optimal delivery paths
Uses IP addressing for packet delivery
Layer 3 devices (routers) operate at this layer
Layer 2: Data Link Layer
Focuses on physical addressing for data transmission
Receives packets from Network Layer (with IP address)
Adds physical MAC (Media Access Control) address of receiving endpoint
MAC Addressing:
Network Interface Card (NIC) has unique MAC address
MAC addresses set by manufacturer and burned into NIC
Cannot be changed (but can be spoofed)
Physical MAC address used to identify where to send data
Responsibilities:
Present data in suitable format for transmission
Package data into frames for sending over physical layer
Key Points:
Handles physical addressing using MAC addresses
Obtains IP addresses from Network Layer and adds MAC addresses
Prepares data for transmission over the Physical Layer
Layer 1 Physical- For example ethernet cables

Packets and Frames
Small pieces of data that form a larger message/information
Encapsulation
Process discussed in OSI model
Packet: Contains IP addresses
Frame: Data inside packet after encapsulating info stripped away
Advantages of Packets
Efficient communication across networked devices
Less chance of bottlenecking than sending large messages at once
Example: Loading website image - sent in small pieces, reconstructed on computer



Ports
Essential for data exchange
Analogy: Ships docking at compatible ports in a harbor
Ports enforce compatibility rules for devices communicating
Port Numbers
Numerical values between 0 and 65535
Risk of losing track of applications using each port
Standard Port Assignment
Associate applications/software with standard port numbers
Example: Web browsers use port 80
Allows different software to interpret data consistently
Common Ports
Ports between 0 and 1024 are common ports
Standard rules assigned for common protocols/applications



To connect to a port such as 1234 using the IP address 8.8.8.8 you use this command:
 
nc 8.8.8.8 1234

Firewalls:
Operate at layers 3 and 4. A stateful firewall inspects the entire connection while the stateless firewall inspects the individual packets.




DNS
DNS (Domain Name System) is like an address book for the internet. It helps computers find the right addresses (IP addresses) for websites, email servers, and other online services.
There are different types of DNS records, like different sections in the address book, each serving a specific purpose:
A Record
This record maps a website's domain name (like www.example.com) to its actual IP address (like 192.168.1.100) for regular internet connections (IPv4).
AAAA Record
Similar to the A record, but for the newer type of internet addresses called IPv6 (like 2001:db8:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888).
CNAME Record
This record is like a nickname. It allows one domain name (like store.example.com) to point to another domain name (like example.shopify.com).
MX Record
This record tells your computer where to send emails for a particular domain (like example.com). It lists the email server addresses and their priorities.
TXT Record
This record can hold any text-based information. It's often used to verify domain ownership or list authorized email servers to prevent spam.
So, DNS records act like different sections in an address book, helping computers find the right addresses for various online services by providing the necessary information in different formats.
TLD (Top-Level Domain)
Most righthand part of a domain name (e.g., .com in tryhackme.com)
Two types: gTLD (Generic Top Level) and ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain)
gTLD historically indicated purpose (e.g., .com for commercial, .org for organizations)
ccTLD indicated geography (e.g., .ca for Canada, .co.uk for United Kingdom)
Over 2000 new gTLDs available (e.g., .online, .club, .website, .biz)
Second-Level Domain
In tryhackme.com, "tryhackme" is the Second-Level Domain
Limited to 63 characters + TLD
Can only use a-z, 0-9, and hyphens (no consecutive hyphens or starting/ending with hyphens)
Subdomain
Sits on the left-hand side of the Second-Level Domain (e.g., admin in admin.tryhackme.com)
Same creation restrictions as Second-Level Domain (63 characters, a-z, 0-9, hyphens)
Can use multiple subdomains separated by periods (e.g., jupiter.servers.tryhackme.com)
Length must be kept to 253 characters or less
No limit to the number of subdomains
What Happens When You Make a DNS Request
Client checks local cache for requested domain
If found, uses cached IP address
If not found, sends request to recursive DNS server (usually ISP's DNS server)
Recursive DNS server checks its own cache
If found, returns IP address to client
If not found, queries root DNS servers
Root servers provide address of Top Level Domain (TLD) nameservers for requested domain's TLD (.com, .org, etc.)
Recursive server queries TLD nameservers for address of authoritative nameservers for requested domain
Authoritative nameservers provide requested domain's IP address to recursive server
Recursive server caches response and returns IP address to client
Client uses IP address to connect to requested domain
DNS responses cached based on Time to Live (TTL) value to minimize future lookups
Multiple redundant authoritative nameservers used for reliability




Vulnerability Searching
NVD keeps track of CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) -- whether or not there is an exploit publicly available -- so it's a really good place to look if you're researching vulnerabilities in a specific piece of software. CVEs take the form: CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER

ExploitDB tends to be very useful for hackers, as it often actually contains exploits that can be downloaded and used straight out of the box. It tends to be one of the first stops when you encounter software in a CTF or pentest.
If you're inclined towards the CLI on Linux, Kali comes pre-installed with a tool called "searchsploit" which allows you to search ExploitDB from your own machine. This is offline, and works using a downloaded version of the database, meaning that you already have all of the exploits already on your Kali Linux!
Ex: use searchsploit fuel cms to search for exploits for fuel cms
To view the CVE number in linux terminal use searchsploit -x /path/to/exploit/directory/exploit_id.rb          Replacing /path/to/exploit/directory/exploit_id.rb with the actual path and filename of the exploit you want to view.
